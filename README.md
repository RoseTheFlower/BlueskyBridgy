The goal of this repository is to create a directory of Bluesky accounts available from the Fediverse (e.g. Mastodon).

It would be great to have a neutral human-verified summary for each account (e.g. "CEO of Bluesky", "Investigative reporter covering X" or "Tech content creator") in a new column, so feel free to send pull requests to that end.
